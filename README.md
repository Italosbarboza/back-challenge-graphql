## How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution
- I chose the technologies based on what I'm most familiar. Then case, i choose TypeOrm as ORM and Mysql as SGBD.
## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission
- Yes. As I knew very little about graphql. I would study the documentation more and make a better implementation
## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time
- I would study more about graphql to improve the routes and structure of the application.
